Setting up this blog to act as an online hub for stuff that isn't twitter or tumblr or some other walled garden.

While social media provides an instant supply of audience, material, feedback etc the kind of writing it produces is limited and leans heavily towards the meta â€“ you end up commenting about comments about comments, which is fine for feeding the infernal discourse machine but also makes it harder to develop an idea into longer form, or something more substantial, or even just to experiment with form as well as content.

Maybe this will fix that.
